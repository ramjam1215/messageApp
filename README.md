I feel like i'm picking this up slowly, but this week i made some leaps and bounds while reading and working on this application.
Looking back at it, its a very easy assignment. But, I was extremely nervous about screwing up some the git and angular commands. Now I'm alot more competent on using the command prompt and github plus understanding the interaction between components, services, and objects in my application. I now my code and my html suck. But, i'm starting to cook with gas now.

finished most of problem 1
- I have added the my-button component and the my-image component.
- I also added the my-service, which is located within the my-button component.
-my-service will take the bTrigger property from my-button and change it to the opposite boolean value(proof of concept right now)
- I still need to render the image, it doesn't seem to want to show me the image so i have an alternate text string for now(i need to post on Slack)
- I am seeing a Cross-Origin Read Blocking when the app tries to load the image. Need to focus on this now

finished problem 2
-dealt with css and ngClass; i needed to use a key:value pair to toggle the class being used on the button element.

Finished problems 3 & 4
- I added the models folder, which has some really basic classes, properties, and functions
- I also added the *ngFor directive, which lets me iterate through an array of messages
