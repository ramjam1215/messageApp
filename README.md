Currently working on question 1
-I have added the my-button component and the my-image component.
-I also added the my-service, which is located within the my-button component.
-my-service will take the bTrigger property from my-button and change it to the opposite boolean value(proof of concept right now)
-I still need to render the image, it doesn't seem to want to show me the image so i have an alternate text string for now(i need to post on Slack)
