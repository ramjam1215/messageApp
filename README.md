Author's notes: I feel like i'm picking this up slowly, but this week i made some leaps and bounds while reading and working on this application. Looking back at it, its a very easy assignment. But, I was extremely nervous about screwing up some the git and angular commands. Now I'm alot more competent on using the command prompt and github plus understanding the interaction between components, services, and objects in my application. I now my code and my html suck. But, i'm starting to cook with gas now.

finished problem 1
- I have added the my-button component and the my-image component.
- I also added the my-service, which is located within the my-button component.
-my-service will take the bTrigger property from my-button and change it to the opposite boolean value(proof of concept right now)
- I rendered my own image that i saved in the assets folder (FYI: its an appropriate image, i hope you enjoy).

finished problem 2
- dealt with css and ngClass; i needed to use a key:value pair to toggle the class being used on the button element.

Finished problems 3 & 4
- I added the models folder, which has some really basic classes, properties, and functions
- I also added the *ngFor directive, which lets me iterate through an array of messages
